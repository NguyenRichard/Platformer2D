# Squishy Square

A platformer in which you play a square that squishes when you jump.

## Goal

During a Game Engine class we had to code a 2D platformer, handling all physics and collisions ourselves, and making user feedback.

## Work achieved

We created a 2D plateformer with a double jump. The color or the cube changes depending on how many jumps are available. The cube can wall jump. There are effects on jump (squishing) and level end (particles). We added effect area that can apply a force or a speed to the player.
We designed three levels to show those features.
